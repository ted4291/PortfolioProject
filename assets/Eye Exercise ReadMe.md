Eye Exercise

This a Javascript-based project which involves creating an image of an eye that follows
the mouse pointer around the screen. This project involves the importation of CSS stylesheets
and JavaScript files.

One could run this project by opening the "Index.html" file. 

This project could be made more complete with a scripting rewrite or by incorporating
more aspects of the guidance file. Additionally, maybe there could be more eyes following
the mouse pointer at varying delays, which could creating a more interesting overall
animated image.
