PacMen Exercise

This a Javascript-based project which imports/appends PacMen images,
then has them bounce and move around the screen. This project involves appending
to the Dom and time-based looping.

One could run this project by opening the "Index.html" file. 

This project could use continued function development for more robust and complete
function, and could also use the addition of a diversity of images for an increased
stylistic component (ex: could ghosts be added in addition to a Pac Man image?).
